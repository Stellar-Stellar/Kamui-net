        <div class="big-text">Who is Kamui Uehara?</div>
        <div class="small-text">Assassinating government officials, Kamui Uehara is otherwise known as the King of Crime.
            His motives are unclear; all that we know is that he acts alone, apparently under employment as a hitman, though the
            identity of his employer remains unknown. Now, Kamui is on a killing spree once again.
            His atrocious crimes are being followed and reported by the mass media on a daily basis. Kamui's actions are causing disarray and confusion among us.
            We don't know who he is. There is no way for the citizens to understand what is happening. They imagine things as they see fit, as if they were reading
            a work of fiction. It is similar to the hopeful mindset people have towards the new century. What do people look for in Kamui? He is their hope.
            No; they make him into their hope. That is why Kamui will continue to appear...forever.
